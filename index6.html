  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Do's</h2>
    <p>1. During an Earthquake
        Drop, Cover, and Hold On – Drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy table or furniture, and hold on until shaking stops.
        <br>
        2. Stay Indoors if you are already inside. Most injuries occur when people try to move to another location.
        <br>
        3. Protect Your Head and Neck with your arms or something soft like a pillow or book.
        <br>
        4. Stay Away from Windows and Glass – These can shatter and cause injury.
        <br>
        5. Turn Off Gas and Electricity only if you smell gas or see damaged wires.
        <br>
        6. Use Stairs Instead of Elevators – Elevators may become stuck or malfunction.
        <br>
        7. Remain Calm and reassure others around you.
        <br>
        8. If Outdoors, move to an open area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.
        <br>
        9. If Driving, stop your vehicle in a clear area away from bridges, overpasses, and power lines. Stay inside until the shaking stops.</p>

    <h2>Dont's</h2>
    <p>1. Don’t Run Outside – You are more likely to be injured by falling debris.
        <br>
       2.  Don’t Use Elevators – Power may fail, trapping you inside.
        <br>
       3. Don’t Stand Near Windows, Mirrors, or Heavy Objects that could fall.
        <br>
       4. Don’t Light Candles or Matches if you suspect a gas leak.
        <br>
       5. Don’t Panic or Rush – It can cause stampedes or accidents.
        <br>
       6. Don’t Go Near Coastal Areas immediately after the shaking stops—risk of tsunamis.
        <br>
       7. Don’t Use Your Phone Unnecessarily – Keep lines open for emergency use.
        <br>
       8. Don’t Believe or Spread Rumors – Rely on official updates only.</p>

    <h2>Essential Kit</h2>
    <p> 1. Drinking Water – At least 3 liters per person per day (for at least 3 days)

        <br>
        7. Essential Medicines – For diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, etc.
        <br>
        8. Copies of Important Documents – ID proof, medical records, insurance (in a waterproof bag)
        <br>
        9. Hygiene Supplies – Hand sanitizer, tissues, soap, sanitary pads
