  <div class="content">
    <h2>Do's</h2>
    <p>
      1. Stay calm and monitor weather updates from official sources.<br>
      2. Move to higher ground or upper floors if flooding occurs.<br>
      3. Turn off electricity and gas connections before evacuating.<br>
      4. Keep an emergency kit ready with essentials like food, water, flashlight, and medicines.<br>
      5. Drink only clean or boiled water to avoid infections.<br>
      6. Help children, elderly, and differently-abled individuals during evacuation.<br>
      7. Use waterproof bags to protect important documents.<br>
      8. Stay indoors unless absolutely necessary.<br>
      9. If you must walk through water, use a stick to check depth and obstacles.<br>
      10. Follow evacuation orders and routes issued by authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>Don'ts</h2>
    <p>
      1. Don’t walk or drive through floodwaters — they may be deeper or faster than they appear.<br>
      2. Don’t use electrical appliances if you're wet or in standing water.<br>
      3. Don’t consume water or food that has come into contact with floodwater.<br>
      4. Don’t spread or believe in rumors — stay informed via official sources.<br>
      5. Don’t ignore evacuation instructions from authorities.<br>
      6. Don’t light candles or matches if you suspect a gas leak.<br>
      7. Don’t leave pets or animals behind during evacuation.<br>
      8. Don’t go near rivers, bridges, or large trees during heavy rain.<br>
      9. Don’t re-enter your home until it's declared safe by officials.<br>
      10. Don’t touch downed power lines — stay far away and report them.
    </p>

    <h2>Essential Kit</h2>
    <p>
      1. Bottled drinking water (at least 3 liters per person per day)<br>
      2. Non-perishable food (dry fruits, biscuits, canned food)<br>
      3. Torch/flashlight with spare batteries<br>
      4. First aid kit and essential personal medications<br>
      5. Power bank and phone charger<br>
      6. Battery-operated radio for emergency updates<br>
      7. Waterproof pouch with ID proofs and important documents<br>
      8. Extra clothes and rainwear<br>
      9. Basic hygiene products: sanitizer, tissue, sanitary pads<br>
      10. Cash in small denominations<br>
      11. Emergency whistle, rope, and multipurpose knife<br>
      12. Emergency contact list with local helpline numbers
    </p>

    <h2>Flood Resistant Home</h2>
    <p>
      1. Elevate electrical systems — including wiring, sockets, switches, and circuit breakers above potential flood levels.<br>
      2. Use water-resistant building materials for walls, floors, and furniture.<br>
      3. Install sump pumps with battery backup to remove accumulated water from basements.<br>
      4. Build barriers (like floodwalls or levees) around your home if it’s in a flood-prone area.<br>
      5. Seal basement walls with waterproofing compounds.<br>
      6. Improve drainage around your home — keep gutters and storm drains clear.<br>
      7. Elevate or relocate appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators.<br>
      8. Anchor fuel tanks to prevent them from floating or tipping during floods.<br>
      9. Store valuables and documents in waterproof, elevated containers.<br>
      10. Landscape with native plants that absorb excess rainwater and reduce runoff.
    </p>
    <h2>Survival Skills</h2>
<p>
  1. Move to Higher Ground Immediately – Avoid low-lying areas.<br>
  2. Avoid Walking or Driving Through Flood Water – Even shallow water can be dangerous.<br>
  3. Disconnect Electrical Appliances – To avoid short circuits or electrocution.<br>
  4. Listen to Weather Updates – Use battery-powered radio or phone.<br>
  5. Stay Inside Unless Evacuation is Advised – Don’t roam unnecessarily.<br>
  6. Use Life Jackets or Floatation Aids – Especially for kids or non-swimmers.<br>
  7. Purify Water Before Drinking – Use purifiers or boil water.<br>
  8. Avoid Contact with Floodwater – It may be contaminated.<br>
  9. Store Essentials Where Water Won’t Reach – Food, medicine, documents.<br>
  10. Help Neighbors and the Needy – Elderly or injured may need assistance.
</p>
<h2>Recovery and Resources</h2>
<p>
  1. Ensure Safety First – Check for hazards like gas leaks, electrical issues, or structural damage.<br>
  2. Seek Financial Assistance – Apply for government aid, flood insurance, or disaster relief funds.<br>
  3. Rebuild Homes and Property – Work with local authorities for safe rebuilding guidelines.<br>
  4. Clean and Sanitize – Properly clean flood-damaged items to prevent mold and bacteria.<br>
  5. Access Medical Assistance – Seek treatment for injuries, infections, or mental health support.<br>
  6. Reconnect with Community – Join local support groups or recovery initiatives.<br>
  7. Secure Temporary Housing – If your home is uninhabitable, explore shelters or relocation resources.<br>
  8. Donate or Volunteer – Contribute to recovery efforts through donations or volunteer work.<br>
  9. Stay Updated – Follow authorities for recovery steps and guidelines in your area.<br>
  10. Be Patient – Recovery from floods can take time; stay resilient and seek help when needed.
